Do you have burning questions about the world of academia? Are you unsure of how to approach job applications and wonder what academic life will look like a few years down the line? The good news is that others have been where you are before. At ScientiFika, we have a diverse crowd of bachelor, master, and PhD students, as well as postdocs. This provides a unique opportunity to ask each other questions about academic life and share experiences to help one another. We encourage everyone to join us this Friday with your questions for an informal group discussion.

You can ask questions anonymously at the event or submit your questions before the event, for both options use the form https://app.sli.do/event/9Fsq2sVAGSa7uBLkf1tomt (or slido.com with code 2568323), where you can also vote for the questions you like to discuss.
