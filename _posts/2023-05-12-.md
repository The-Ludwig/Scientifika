Cosmic rays are highly energetic particles that originate from astrophysical sources such as pulsars or supernovae. As they travel through space, they interact in various processes, such as magnetic fields and gas, which can cause them to produce antimatter. In addition to their astrophysical origins, cosmic rays can provide important clues about the nature of dark matter in our galaxy. If dark matter particles annihilate or decay, they can produce antimatter particles that would be detectable in cosmic-ray data. By studying these cosmic-ray signatures, we can learn more about the properties of dark matter and its role in the universe.

During my talk, I will provide a personal introduction to cosmic rays and dark matter, and showcase a few examples of how and where to search for the unique signatures of dark matter. I will also explain how we can use antiprotons and antideuteron to constrain the annihilation cross-section of dark matter in our galaxy.
