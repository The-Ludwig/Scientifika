FysikShow is a collaborative outreach project from Stockholm University with the aim of raising interest in natural science and research. FysikShow, consisting of a team of 8 PhD students, comes to schools and participates in various science events. We think it is both important and fun to use experiments to understand physics. Therefore, we show experiments to students and work interactively with explanations of the physical background. The school’s slightly more formal physics language is thus brought closer to everyday life and the students’ own experiences. We believe this is important for the students’ curiosity and to show them joy in understanding their own surroundings. This Friday we will tell you more about FysikShow and show you some of our favourite experiments!
