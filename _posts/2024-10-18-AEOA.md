The semester is well-underway and you may have burning questions about academia, job applications, research challenges, or the path ahead. The good news? Others around you have been through similar situations and can offer valuable insights. At this ScientiFika, we bring together a diverse group of bachelor, master, and PhD students, as well as postdocs, creating a unique space to ask and answer questions about academic life. Whether you want to discuss career paths, share tips, or get advice on balancing work and life, this session is designed for open, informal discussions.
