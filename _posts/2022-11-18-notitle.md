In 2014, protesters from the indigenous people of Hawaiâ€™i blocked the groundbreaking ceremony for the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea. The conflict highlighted how astronomy has a colonial dimension that is still present today. In this talk I will discuss the colonial history of astronomy, as well as current conflicts. After the talk, I invite everyone to have a joint discussion around the question: Does our knowledge of the universe come with a social and moral cost?
