What actually happens inside the brain during a severe infection? In my research, I explore one of the most dangerous infection scenarios: pneumococcal meningitis.

I am Simona Serra, PhD student in Karolinska Institute. My projects focus on fighting antibiotic resistance by the surprising, groundbreaking discovery of a new strong potential drug: AnnexinA1. It shows strong antimicrobial properties against a wide spectrum of bacteria. Another key point of my projects is the investigation on the mechanism of action of Streptococcus pneumoniae's major weapon: the toxin pneumolysin.
