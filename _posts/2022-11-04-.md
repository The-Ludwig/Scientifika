Do you have burning questions about the world of academia? Are you unsure of how to approach job applications and wonder what academic life will look like a few years down the line? The good news is that others have been where you are before. At Scientific Fika, we have a diverse crowd of bachelor, master, and PhD students, as well as postdocs. This provides a unique opportunity to ask each other questions about academic life and share experiences to help one another. We encourage everyone to join us this Friday with your questions, or already send them in by replying to this email.
