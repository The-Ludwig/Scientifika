<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
Have you ever wondered how to solve tan(x)=x? <br>
Exact solutions are out of reach, <br>
But an approximation I will teach. <br>
If you want the asymptotic power,<br>
You have to sacrifice a parameter.<br>
Find a dominant balance<br>
To crack the transcendence.<br>
And always go to the next order!<br>
