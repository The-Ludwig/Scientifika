Simple question: What is the Universe really made of? Yet, not-so-simple answer: Mostly stuff we can't see! Join me on an astronomical journey into the mysterious world of "dark matter," where we will explore how we use gamma rays---the most energetic bursts of light---to hunt for clues of dark matter. In this talk, I will outline the path from early gamma-ray astrophysical observations to today's most sensitive gamma-ray missions, like the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and look ahead to the next big leap: the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Along the way, we will encounter exotic particles like axions or WIMPs that could help us finally unlock the nature of the Universe.
