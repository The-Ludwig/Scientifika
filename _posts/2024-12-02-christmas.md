To finish the term, it is our pleasure to invite you all to our special Christmas themed ScientiFika on Friday 13th December, where we will be moving from Nordita to the Restaurant Proviant in Albano Hus 2.

**When**: Friday, December 13th, 16:30

**Where**: Albano Hus 2, Restaurant Proviant -> Near the stage

**Address**: Albanov√§gen 24

You can expect a special programme, slightly different from what you are used to, which will also include a special Christmas Fika in the form of finger foods with mulled wine!
Outside of the chance to mingle with your fellow students and researchers, the event will include a special Bingo and also a GONG SHOW. This will be a series of short (2 minutes) talks given mainly by ***students***, where you will have the option to shortly present what you worked on or are working on at the moment, be it a Bachelor/Master thesis, interesting project during an internship or anything else you'd like to share. It will give you the opportunity to practice talking about your topic in front of an audience and also to take on the challenge to do so in 2 minutes!
(Note that the GONG SHOW is also available to PhD students, but Bachelor/Master students will get priority in case there is not enough places)

If you want to join us at this event, [please fill out this form](https://forms.gle/ocJn16ipNGfF74h8A).
There, you can also sign up for the GONG SHOW (places are limited so don't wait!)
