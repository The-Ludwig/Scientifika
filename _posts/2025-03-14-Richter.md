To combat climate change and pollution, energy production is shifting towards renewables. However, many of the leading technologies, notably solar and wind power, are very variable. This poses challenges to the stability of the power grid, as well as uncertainty that can dampen investments in renewables. Flower was founded in Stockholm in 2020 to address these challenges and now sports 140 employees. We are active in three countries and expanding to six others. 
I will introduce what we do and also touch on my role as a data engineer, including how I transitioned into it after my postdoc at SU.
