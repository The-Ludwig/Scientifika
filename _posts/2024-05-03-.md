Discussing the weather has somehow become a symbol of a topic to resort to when conversation runs dry. Which is a shame, because weather is so much more than just small talk - it’s integral to renewable energy production. In this talk, I aim to put weather conversations in a new light. As a data scientist at an energy-tech company, I will share insights and anecdotes from within the energy sector. How did Europe survive the energy crisis? And how can new AI-based weather models be used for renewables forecasting? Hopefully, this will give you some weather-related conversation starters that can follow or replace the usual “Cold outside today, isn’t it?”
