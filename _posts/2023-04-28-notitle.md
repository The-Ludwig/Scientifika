It was recently said of/by artificial intelligence [AI], ” [it] flows like a boundless river, shaping and transforming the world with unrelenting vigor”.

It is clear that AI and machine learning are powerful tools, but how powerful? To what extent are they only tools? But more, when will we stop having a say in their say in the world’s future or our interpretation of the world?

This talk will be an account of my experience with learned machines, in and outside research. I’ll recount my introduction to the topic and my applications including to one of the biggest problems in physics. I will then broaden up and discuss wider applications and implications, to science, life and the future, particularly focusing on ChatGPT, with the hope of convincing you to get into the river before the torrent comes (and not become my (our?) parents!).
