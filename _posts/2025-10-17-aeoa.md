The semester is in full swing, and you might have questions about academia, job applications, research hurdles, or what lies ahead in your career. The good news? You’re not alone—many around you have faced similar challenges and can share valuable insights. This ScientiFika brings together bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD students, as well as postdocs, to create an open and welcoming space for discussing all aspects of academic life. Whether you’re curious about career paths, want to swap practical tips, or need advice on balancing work and life, this session is all about informal, honest conversations. You can submit questions in advance or ask them anonymously during the event using [this form](https://app.sli.do/event/i8RhrRkQAMEbvtpqz7zWzP) (or visit slido.com with code 5405239).
We’re looking forward to an engaging and supportive discussion!
