Is our universe similar to a hologram? This is what is suggested by holography — the idea that gravitational theories may be described by theories on a lower-dimensional boundary, much like a hologram encodes a 3D image on a 2D surface. 
Let me take you on a short journey through this exciting topic, from the origins of the holographic principle to the dualities that connect gravity and quantum physics, ultimately giving you a glimpse into how holography can be used to study strongly coupled systems in particle physics — something I had the pleasure of exploring over the past year during my master’s thesis work at SU.
