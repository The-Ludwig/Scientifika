Scandinavian peoples have been skiing for thousands of years; today more than 50 million people worldwide enjoy recreational skiing. Skiing, combining high speeds with snow's unique properties, offers an excellent venue to demonstrate physical principles. In this talk we'll discuss the physics that underlies every aspect of the sport, from the dynamics of turns and the material properties of composite skis, to the terrifying power of avalanches.
