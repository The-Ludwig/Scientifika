Gravitational-wave detectors now give us the ability to “hear” the last few orbits as two neutron stars (or black holes) merge. The music produced by these last few orbits hides a plethora of insight, such as how these binaries are formed and the lives and afterlives of massive stars. Similarly, for many mergers we can also “see” the aftermath across the electromagnetic spectrum.  In this talk, I will discuss what we can learn from the observations of these compact object mergers individually in gravitational waves and in electromagnetic radiation, together, for events where we have observations with both, and holistically, as a population worth greater than the sum of its parts.
