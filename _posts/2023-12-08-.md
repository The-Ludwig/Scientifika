In this scientific fika, we delve into the field of quantum magnonics, a cutting-edge direction poised to explore the hybrid quantum information platforms based on magnons, quantum of spin waves. I will explain concepts like magnons and discuss their properties. We will explore recent achievements and their potential to develop the magnonic platform, such as their robustness, tunability and lower power consumption, along with the rich physics underpinning them. A full-fledged quantum era may still be distant for most of our daily life, except of researchers/physicists, but there are quite a few intriguing facts to appreciate about how quantum magnonics is shaping the challenges of future quantum applications.
