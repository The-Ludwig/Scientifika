Modern cosmology has radically transformed humanity’s sense of place in the cosmos. In The View from the Center of the Universe, physicist Joel R. Primack and cultural philosopher Nancy Ellen Abrams present an effort to bridge modern physical cosmology with cultural narratives and broader questions of meaning, identity, and our collective future.

We will examine the book’s central premise: although Earth is not physically at the center of the universe, humans occupy a “central” position in logarithmic size-scale space, are composed of the rarest form of matter in the cosmos, and live at a distinctive moment in the universe’s evolution.
