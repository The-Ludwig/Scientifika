The Hubble tension is a disagreement between measured values of the rate of expansion of the local universe and the values inferred from early universe physics, potentially a sign of new cosmological physics. The SH0ES collaboration measures the local expansion through a “distance ladder” based on stellar distances and geometry. As the SH0ES value is the most precise direct measurement, the robustness of the SH0ES distance ladder is a key question for modern cosmology. In my talk, I will discuss my work to demonstrate the robustness of the SH0ES measurement.
