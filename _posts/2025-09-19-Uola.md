In this Scientfika talk, I will discuss Einstein's most cited paper: the EPR argument. I will start with a historic discussion on the exchange between Einstein and Schr√∂dinger, as well as Bohr to shed light on the EPR paradox. From here, I will move to the modern quantum information formulation of the EPR steering effect due to Wiseman et al. and discuss how recent results have found a mathematical equivalence between this puzzling effect and the operational notion of measurement incompatibility.
