Us: Science, of course. 

World: But what does that even mean? 

Us: Ah, we are investigating what things out there in the world are doing. 

World: But what things? 

Me: Well, personally, I am constantly hassling with wavevectors in Quantum Mechanics or exotic fluids such as dark energy. 

World: That's cool, but how do we know these things are real? Do we actually see them? Do you touch them? 

Me: Hmm, not really... 

Us: So how do we know they are actually a THING? 

Me: Maybe because they seem to work just fine? 

World: There has been plenty of so-called THINGS in the history of science that no longer are a THING though... and folks back then thought they also worked just fine! 

Me: Right, right... 

-- And then Us all sit in contemplation during the ScientiFika and start to wonder how to make sense of this all, while the World keep a judgy eye on us. 

\*\*\*

Come and join us for a quick walk on the Philosophy of Science!
