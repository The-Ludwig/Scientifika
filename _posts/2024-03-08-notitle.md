Are you curious about the underlying physics of traffic flow, a swinging pendulum, population growth, and other time-evolving systems? Join ScientiFika this Friday for a concise introduction to the field of dynamical systems. The talk will highlight its fundamental concepts and focus on key issues like nonlinearity, scale separation, and high dimensionality. Through examples ranging from simple chaotic maps to more complex systems like turbulent flows, we will explore the core principles and address the significant challenges within the field. The aim is to offer an accessible yet thorough entry point for those new to dynamical systems, while outlining the open questions and challenges that propel the field forward.
