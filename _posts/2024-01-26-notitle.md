After working as a postdoctoral researcher in supernova cosmology, Rahman Amandius switched to a career in industry. He is currently the head of machine learning and data science at Voi, a company that rents out electric scooters and bikes in more than 100 cities throughout Europe. Are you curious which skills are transferable from supernova explosions to electric scooters? What are the differences and similarities between working in academia and industry? And which algorithms lay behind the network of scooters and bikes that many of us use on a daily basis? Join us this Friday to ask Rahman all your questions about the transition from academia to industry!
