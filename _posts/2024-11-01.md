In this talk, I will draw on my experience as a clinical radiotherapy physicist to present on how we use physics to fight cancer (and how it can sometimes feel like the physics is fighting back). I will give a brief summary of the history of radiotherapy, its current application in clinical practice, the physics underpinning the most common form of radiotherapy, and an overview of current areas of research and development within radiotherapy physics.
