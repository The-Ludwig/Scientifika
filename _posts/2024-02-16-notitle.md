We live in an exciting time for high-energy and fundamental physics broadly defined. Advances in particle physics and cosmology, theory and experiment, technology and computation, etc. have allowed us to piece together the most precise understanding of nature on the smallest and largest scales. At the same time, important open questions remain that will require further theoretical insights, and a wide range of large and small experiments to answer. Given the longer timescales and higher costs of these endeavors, the US high-energy physics community has been undertaking a community and prioritization study with global participation roughly every decade to plan for the future. In this broad talk, I will describe the outcome of the recent so-called Snowmass and P5 processes, the prioritized experiments and their scientific goals, and some lessons I learned from my involvement.
