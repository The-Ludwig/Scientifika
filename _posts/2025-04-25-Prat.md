What is the relation between art and science? How do they benefit from each other? Join me in this fun journey through some science and some art! In this ScientiFika I will first talk about the science I do, that is, how we can use weak gravitational lensing to learn about dark energy. Then, I will describe my journey through publishing Chicago in Color, a photography book with a minimalist and colorful style that especially highlights disfavored areas from Chicago. Finally, I will give my thoughts on the relationship between art and science and future directions I am thinking about.
