Meta-abstract: As I’m filling in this week’s spot on short notice, the talk’s title and content remain on a mental superposition between two states: a talk about emergence focussing both on spacetime emergence and the emergence of the classical world, and a talk about what is real from a scientific realist perspective. If we are lucky enough, the collapse of the talk’s mental wavefunction will happen due to a measurement on a different basis, and a superposition of both topics will be discussed! Whatever happens, the plan is to make our heads spin!
