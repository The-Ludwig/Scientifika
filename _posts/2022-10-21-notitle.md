What scares you the most about your research? Do you worry about all the painful and terrible ways our Universe can end? Or about monstrous black holes, violent and too nearby explosions, and ghostly galaxies? This Friday Steve, Nushkia, Stephen and I will talk about what keeps us up at night (but don't worry, we'll keep it fun and won't mention job applications).
