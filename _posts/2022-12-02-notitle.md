The physical meaning, or interpretation, of the formalism of quantum physics is still debated a century after its conception. I review some of these interpretations, and how they address the measurement problem and Bell’s theorem. I argue that non-uniqueness of interpretations is common also in classical physics. What’s then so special about the interpretations of quantum mechanics? Come to the scientific fika to find out and discuss!
