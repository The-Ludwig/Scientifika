Primordial black holes are black holes that might have formed in the early Universe. Their masses potentially span a range from as low as the Planck scale up to many orders of magnitude above the solar mass. This, in particular, includes black holes with mass and spin comparable to those discovered by LIGO/Virgo. These may well be primordial in nature, which could also be true for certain confirmed microlensing events in the planetary-mass range as well as for the seeds for the super-massive black holes in galactic centres. After a general introduction to primordial black holes, I will discuss observational hints for their existence on multiple scales. I will highlight one particular PBH formation mechanism, which we recently developed, and which is not plagued by exponential fine-tuning like most other scenarios. Here, primordial black hole formation is induced by confinement of heavy quarks. I will discuss phenomenological features of this new mechanism. If time permits, I will discuss an entirely new property of black holes which we recently discovered -- vorticity.
