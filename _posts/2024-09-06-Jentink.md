Have you ever wondered if we’re truly alone in the Universe? That question has captivated me for years, as it has for countless others—philosophers, scientists, and other existentialists—though existentialists might just shrug and say, "Does it really matter?" The vastness of space tempts us to believe that somewhere, another Earth-like world must exist—perhaps even an Earth 2.0, teeming with life as we know it.
In 1995, astronomers discovered the first exoplanet orbiting a star like our Sun, igniting an entirely new branch of astrophysics. Less than 30 years later, this field has exploded, mostly fueled by rapid technological advancements. Yet, as we push our instruments to the limits, it’s not just technology that challenges us—the very stars themselves are revealing unexpected obstacles…
Join me for a journey through the fascinating history of exoplanet discovery, from the first breakthrough to the ambitious future observatories still on the horizon. Together, we’ll explore the challenges encountered along the way, and perhaps uncover a few mysteries yet to be solved.
