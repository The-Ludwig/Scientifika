### Navigating the Leap: From Physics to Data Science
This presentation will spotlight the applicable skills physicists can transfer to the data science sector of the Tech industry. We will delve into the functionality and relevance of various skills and tools valued in academia and how they relate to the needs of the industry. Additionally, we will discuss innovative applications and ongoing research surrounding Large Language Models. Furthermore, we will explore various roles within the data field, providing practical insights into essential skills and hiring practices.

Speakers: Soheb Mandhai, Kunal Deoskar, Nikki Arendse
### Supporting Science with Art
In this short session (starting around 16:45), Soheb, Kunal and Nikki will show how to use different forms of artwork to support and convey the story of your science. We will talk about the process of creating art and discuss different target audiences. With our examples, such as creating comic books about your PhD thesis, using watercolour videos in your talks, and creating 3D animations to visualise your physical models, we hope to inspire a lively discussion about how science can be supported by art! We encourage you to also bring examples of your own artwork.
