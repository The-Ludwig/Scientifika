In this presentation, we will discuss the parallel development of two intriguing and contrasting theories: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Dark Matter (DM). We will cover the specifics of MOND’s departure from classical Newtonian physics and explore its roots, pivotal moments, and its most popular extensions. Then, we will talk about the properties of DM and the various pieces of evidence that propel the DM concept to the forefront of modern cosmology. Through my (un?)biased presentation, my goal is to bring forward a conversation about the MONDian theories and whether and how they fare in comparison to the more widely accepted cosmological standard model.
