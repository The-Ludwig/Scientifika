Peace was an enigmatic and omnipresent concept in the Middle Ages. Then, as today, it was used as a rhetorical device to condemn the use of violence; but it could also be used to motivate that same use of force. Intertwined with the idea of just kingship, the freedom of the church, and the ”right” social order, peace manifested in law became an integral tool in the formation of an early state society in the High Middle Ages. This talk will introduce some of the varying conceptions of peace in the Middle Ages, before zooming in to focus on how and why the concept came to be employed in Medieval Nordic law.
