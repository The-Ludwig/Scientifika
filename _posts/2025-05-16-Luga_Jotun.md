### When Mars Gets Dramatic: Dust Storms and the Shifting Bowshock
#### Sarah Luga
Everybody knows that Mars is a pretty hostile planet. But once every five years, Mars decides to throw a tantrum and unleashes massive dust storms that cover most of its surface. While the drama is undeniable, these storms are actually fascinating to study because of their impact on Mars' atmosphere and overall environment.

In this talk, we’ll dive into the planet’s atmosphere and ask ourselves: do these dust storms have an effect on the atmosphere? And if they do, just how significant are they?
Featuring: how the absence of an inner magnetic field leads to a shifting ionosphere, statistical analyses, and a strange coordinate system!

### Ung Vetenskapssport: Engaging the Next Generation in Science
#### Emma Jotun & Gabriel Bergens
Ung Vetenskapssport is a student-led nonprofit that creates opportunities for curious young people to explore science through camps, competitions, and creative problem solving. One of our goals is creating community through a shared interest in science.

One of our upcoming projects is Physics and Astronomy Camp for high school students with a strong interest in science. The camp is filled with lectures, lab sessions, and collaborative challenges designed to inspire and engage. At our camps student get a chance to learn interesting math and physics, practice problem solving and make lots of new friends through a shared love of physics!

In our talk we will talk more about what we do and how you can get involved!
