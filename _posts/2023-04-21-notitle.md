One of the easiest ways to get funding is betting on quantum computers. But what does that actually mean and when will they be ready? In our talk, we will present trapped ions as a quantum computing platform with a slight twist. Inspired by Rydberg, we excite our ions more than usual which gives us interesting features to play with. We will present the basic concepts of trapped Rydberg ion physics and ongoing projects in the group.
