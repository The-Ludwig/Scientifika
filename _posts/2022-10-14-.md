Olbers’ paradox asks:
Why is the sky dark?

But we can also ask:
Why is the sky reionised?

During the Epoch of Reionisation, the first stars and galaxies were hard at work changing the phase space of the Universe: from neutral to ionised. But how do these sources of light (ionising radiation) perceive each other, and what lies betwixt and between them? In this talk, I will discuss the Epoch of Reionisation in the context of Olbers’ paradox and my own work and hopefully entertain you along the way!
