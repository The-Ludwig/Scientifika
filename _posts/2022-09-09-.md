Or is it?
Metastable states are pervasive in our world, they are close to equilibrium, but not quite. Depending on the evaluated system, they might slip into equilibrium in the blink of an eye or they might stay in this semi-equilibrated state for years and years. The latter potentially fooling us into believing that we are looking at the final state.
Whilst some might argue that there is “no point” in studying them as they are not in equilibrium, it is evident simply by the ubiquitous use of diamonds both in jewellery and science that there is value in them. Throughout my PhD and postdoc, I have been studying different metastable phases, so come join me in my talk where I will share my research on at least one of these wonky states.
