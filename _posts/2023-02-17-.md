Do you have burning questions about the world of academia? Are you unsure how to approach job applications and wonder what academic life will look like a few years down the line? Let's ask the people who navigated this landscape successfully and obtained a permanent position! In this week's Scientific Fika event, a panel of professors will answer your questions and talk about their personal experiences in academia. We are delighted to have Ariel Goobar, Sara Strandberg, Ragnhild Lunnan, Fawad Hassan, and Jens Jasche on the panel.
