Nuclear technology is undoubtedly one of the most important sources of base-load electricity generation, contributing approximately 11.2% to global electricity production. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), nuclear power is expected to play an increasingly important role as a source of electricity production around the world, in particular in Asia and the Pacific Rim, since demand for electricity is expected to rise significantly in these regions in the coming years. Further, it is anticipated that nuclear power reactors in the future will not be as large as they are today, with more than 1,000 MW of capacity, allowing for the introduction of small modular reactors (SMRs) with a maximum capacity of 300 MWe, which can be constructed in factories and transported to various sites by truck, train, or ship. The SMR alternatives are expected to address issues such as safety, non-proliferation, waste management, public opinion, social license, and economic competitiveness.
