Decision making ranges in difficulty from the neighborhood of the arguably trivial to the province of the obnoxiously complicated. Of potential good news, those of us afflicted by its hardships may find solace that a mathematical framework can offer some aid: game theory. In this context, a game is defined as a mathematical modeling of strategic interactions and the decision-making these involve between a group of “players.” Game theory, very broadly, studies such interactions and provides a formalism to define optimal strategy based on a set of outcomes. Game theory has in turn affected and at times significantly influenced several areas such as economics, computer science, psychology and more. Although its abstract is a picture of formality, the talk itself will feature an informal overview of some key concepts in game theory, such as non-cooperative games and Nash equilibria, together with their historical development.
