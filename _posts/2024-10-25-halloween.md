ðŸŽƒðŸŽƒðŸŽƒFor Halloween, we present not one, not two, but three very scary talks!ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»


#### Spooky Singularities: Revealing Supermassive Black Holes in the Early Universe 
##### Alice Young
Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside in the nuclei of most massive galaxies and are understood to contribute to galaxy formation in a multitude of ways, the origin of SMBHs in the early universe is one of the remaining questions in modern astrophysics. 

In this talk I will discuss some of the theoretical formation scenarios that have been proposed and how astronomers can begin to test the predications of these models using observational data. In particular, I will present our recent re-imaging campaign of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) as well as the detection methods which have yielded the highest number density of SMBHs within the first billion years after the Big Bang reported to date.

#### ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡
##### Liliana Ferreira 
Between the two 20 minutes talks, we will have a smaller 10 minute interlude about bats ðŸ¦‡.

#### Spooky Food 
##### Marjorie Ladd Parada
In the scariest month of the year, I present you with spooky food, food that can kill you, make you sick, or that simply looks like you should not be eating it. In fact, if time allows, I will speak a bit about the spookiest food of all, that which is so bad that you will not it eat even if it is the only thing around, just like in the first manned missions in space, where the food was so bad that the astronauts preferred to stay hungry, and how space food has changed food as we know it.
