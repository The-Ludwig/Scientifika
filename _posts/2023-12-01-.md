Ever wondered what happens to the brain during Alzheimer’s Disease? Or what we can actively do to prevent it and how medical research is tackling this problem?

In this Scientific Fika, we’ll navigate the basics of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia affecting memory, thinking and behaviour. Symptoms eventually grow severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. AD research is split into three main branches: analysis of the molecular mechanism behind AD, developing new drugs, and searching for new biomarkers. We’ll explore why grasping the inner workings of AD is crucial for knowing what new drugs must target. And once we have an available treatment, it’s important to screen the population in the most effective and inexpensive way. I’ll also discuss results from my master’s thesis in which I investigate how cell’s organelles change their organization between mice with and without AD.

Join us this Friday if you’re curious to hear more about how research is fighting AD and what the newest developments in the field are!
