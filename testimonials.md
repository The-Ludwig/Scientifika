We asked our attendants what they thought about ScientiFika in our 2023 Feedback survey.
You can find some of the responses below, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZBmBTGhUsXfazL44iGe_oQ1sGvNiQYBPensLQEiD2E/edit">the full report can be found here <i class="bi bi-file-earmark-text"></i></a>.

"As an audience member, I have found the talks I've seen 
so far to be much more rewarding than a typical research seminar."

    "I strongly believe the Scientific Fika is one of the best OKC/Nordita events for keeping 
in touch with OKC/Nordita research outside of one's own field."

"Besides the vast variety of topics that are made accessible across the board, I have met great people that I wouldn't have otherwise. As the audience is made of academics, the talks remain at a level above the talks that are just public lectures but below the research level (where certainly I wouldn't understand most of them!). Thus, these events have been able to find a sweet spot that is quite rare to see elsewhere."

"Hearing in the discussion session how crushed everyone is by academia was reassuring. But also crushing. But it's generally good to know that everyone else feels sad too. Having an open space for those kinds of discussions is important (i.e. not just people chatting behind a closed door, but a meeting for all juniors where these discussions are accepted and things like this can be admitted freely) - not every department/institute has this kind of forum!"

"Nice way to wind down on Friday. Keeping it to postdocs and below helps make it more relaxed than if professors were there."

"I really enjoy the broader topics, such as philosophy of science and colonialism, these topics are not included in our education and it is nice discussing and listening to these types of talks."

"As a master student, Scientific Fika is one of the few seminars which are easy to attend and that I know of thanks to their emails. I also come in contact with other students and juniors (PhD/postdocs) in a more easy/fun setting than other seminars."

"I've learned about subjects outside of my own in a casual, relaxed format that removes the pressure of asking simple/naive questions to an expert in their field. The post-talk fika discussions are also great, and have allowed me to keep in touch with some people outside of my own department."

"Absolutely! The informal setting has allowed me to experiment more during my talks and try different approaches to engage the audience. I believe the Scientific Fika has consolidated itself as a space where students and postdocs can scientifically hang out with each other."

"Low-pressure environment to chat with peers, including about topics that aren't necessarily related to one's research but where we can have some informal exchange of ideas. It's also a great opportunity to meet people from other departments that have similar interests!"

"The relaxed atmosphere, the idea to give a broad and non-technical talk about anything that interests you in physics (not specifically your own research), and the audience of other junior scientists all contributed to me wanting to give a talk. I think [...] these meetings are a good setting where you can practice giving talks and answering questions in a more relaxed and low-pressure situation than in regular seminars where you are expected to answer more difficult questions and be more technical."
