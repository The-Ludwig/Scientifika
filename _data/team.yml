  text: "Originally from Brazil, he was one of the founders of the ScientiFika. Inspired by lunch talks during his PhD at McGill University which only juniors research could attend while eating pizza, Gui made sure that from the very beginning delicious Fika was served after every talk. Gui mostly worries about foundational questions in physics, and currently does research in quantum gravity by focusing both on the foundations of quantum mechanics and the foundations of gravity. He shares his time between Nordita and the Department of Philosophy, while most of his free time is spent climbing!"
- name: "Nikki Arendse"

  text: "As a Dutch astronomer living in Stockholm, she finds great joy in biking around and ice skating on frozen lakes during winter. Her research focusses on gravitationally lensed supernovae and how they can be applied to determine the Universe’s expansion rate. In addition to beautiful observations of these phenomena, she also uses watercolour paintings to communicate her research. Her passion for science outreach began as a co-founder of ‘Astronomy on Tap’ in Copenhagen, and continues in Stockholm as ScientiFika team member."
- name: "Nadia Flodgren"

  text: "She is a PhD student at Stockholm University but originally from the north of Sweden. In her research she focuses on applying concepts from mathematics to simplify calculations in perturbative quantum field theory. In her free time she enjoys hiking in nature with her dog."
- name: "Ludwig Neste"

  text: "He is a PhD student at Stockholm University, researching the mysterious neutrinos with IceCube, located at the SouthPole. Ludwig joined the team to build this website, so if you find any bugs, he is to blame. He loves trying out new and weird coffees, and is still working on his latte-art."
- name: "Judit Prat"

  text: "As a Nordita postdoctoral fellow, she explores cosmic history by studying galaxy clustering and gravitational lensing. Alongside her research, she is interested in art and photography, highlighted by her upcoming book, \"Chicago in Color,\" which captures her experiences in Chicago through minimalist photography. She also enjoys the outdoors and is eager to learn more about Nordic culture, blending her professional interests with a passion for community and the Scandinavian natural beauty."
- name: "Milena Crnogorčević"

  text: "From Montenegro to Hong Kong, Vermont, and Maryland, Milena found her home in Stockholm in 2023. She is a postdoctoral fellow at the Oskar Klein Centre, keeping herself occupied by thinking about the ways she can use gamma rays, gravitational waves, and neutrinos to search for signatures of dark matter and new physics in the Universe. She is deeply invested in addressing the lack of diversity and equity in the pipeline to becoming an astrophysicist. If not in her office in Albanova, she can be found swimming at Eriksdalsbadet, bouldering, hiking, or getting lost around Stockholm trying to follow the blue dot on Google Maps."
- name: "Pavel Štěch"

  text: "Born in Czechia, Pavel is pursuing a Master’s degree in Theoretical Physics. He came to Stockholm in 2023 after finishing his undergraduate studies in London. When he is not in a library, you can usually find him with a frisbee in his hand, in a climbing gym or just exploring various hot dog stands in the city."
